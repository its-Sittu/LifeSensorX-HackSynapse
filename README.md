**LifeSensorX** is an enterprise-grade, high-performance web ecosystem designed for **real-time vehicular accident detection, automated high-accuracy emergency alerting, and dynamic smart hospital triage queue routing**. 

When a crash is detected by mobile device telematics, the application immediately initiates a high-intensity audio-visual warning. If the user is incapacitated and the countdown expires, LifeSensorX automatically acquires high-accuracy GPS coordinates, dispatches SMS alerts containing a Google Maps link to pre-configured emergency contacts, registers the victim in the hospital's live triage queue, and routes them to the nearest available medical facility.

## 🚀 Key System Features (In-Depth Explanation)

### 1. 📱 Device Telematics & Intelligent Crash Detection
* **High-Frequency $G$-Force Monitoring**: Leverages the HTML5 **DeviceMotion API** to sample real-time device accelerometer changes. It dynamically listens for severe impact forces (extreme velocity changes) representing a vehicular collision.
* **10-Second Alarm Countdown**: To eliminate false alerts (e.g. dropping the phone), a high-intensity red modal is presented alongside a loud looping alarm siren and rhythmic vibration pulses. 
* **User Override Hook**: The user can dismiss the emergency state instantly by tapping **"I'M SAFE"**, which immediately stops the alarm, restores device sensor listening, and prevents emergency contact alerting.

### 2. 📡 Resilient Multi-Channel Emergency Alerting
* **Automated Background SMS**: If the fail-safe timer runs out, the client instantly fetches high-accuracy GPS coordinates and POSTs to the server, which formats the message and dispatches a background alert SMS via the **Fast2SMS Bulk Gateway** to all registered contacts.
* **Smart Client Fallbacks**: If the server API is offline or if emergency contacts are unconfigured, the app falls back to opening native client protocols:
  * **WhatsApp Integration**: Creates pre-filled location templates using the custom `whatsapp://send` URI scheme to bypass manual typing and send coordinates instantly.
  * **Native SMS App Launcher**: Aggregates all contact phone numbers in a comma-separated list to auto-populate the system's native SMS application with the ready-to-send maps link.

### 3. 🏥 Resilient 3-Tier Hospital Locator Engine
* **10 KM Scan Boundary**: Scans the coordinates' radius to compile a list of trauma facilities.
* **Tier 1 (Google Places API - New & Classic)**: The server queries Google's latest text/nearby search indices to retrieve the top 5 medical centers, acquiring detailed metadata like international telephone numbers, ratings, and exact directions.
* **Tier 2 (OpenStreetMap Overpass API Fallback)**: If Google Places API credentials are not provided or the quota is exhausted, the server seamlessly performs a direct HTTP query to OpenStreetMap Overpass API nodes. This requires no API keys and yields real local coordinates.
* **Tier 3 (Mock Sandboxing Data)**: Used for isolated offline testing to guarantee that the application never breaks.
* **Haversine Distance Computing**: On receiving the hospital list, the client calculates the precise line-of-sight distance using the Haversine formula:
  $$d = 2R \arcsin\left(\sqrt{\sin^2\left(\frac{\Delta \phi}{2}\right) + \cos(\phi_1)\cos(\phi_2)\sin^2\left(\frac{\Delta \lambda}{2}\right)}\right)$$
* **Actionable Routing & Dialing**: Users can tap **"Call Now"** to execute a native phone hook (`tel:...`) or **"Directions"** to launch Google Maps navigation directly to the hospital entrance.

### 4. ⚡ Real-Time WebSocket Hospital Dashboard & Patient Triage Queue
* **Instant Triage Registration**: On crash detection, the backend automatically posts a new patient record into the live triage queue (`/api/queue`) with a status of `WAITING` and `severity: "CRITICAL"`.
* **Socket.io Sync Engine**: Broadcasts live updates (`queueUpdate` and `hospitalUpdate` events) to all connected clients and the admin hospital dashboard. This allows trauma wards to view incoming crash victims instantly as they are being transported.
* **Smart Wait-Time Prediction Algorithm**: Calculates estimated wait times in minutes for every incoming patient dynamically using the following criteria:
  * Base consultation time per patient is set to **15 minutes**.
  * Patients are weighted by medical urgency: `CRITICAL: 4`, `HIGH: 3`, `MEDIUM: 2`, `LOW: 1`.
  * The system computes patient position ahead of the current record based on FCFS (First Come, First Served) and severity levels, scaling it by available doctors:
    $$\text{Wait Time} = \lceil \frac{\text{Patients Ahead} \times 15}{\text{Available Doctors}} \rceil$$

### 5. 🛏️ Hospital Resource Manager
* **Bed Ward Tracking**: Keeps a real-time count of total, occupied, and available beds across General, Emergency, and ICU wards.
* **Live Allocation Controls**: Allows hospital administration staff to allocate or free bed resources on the fly, immediately broadcasting the modified numbers to the emergency client interface.

Populate the configuration variables as follows:
```env
PORT=5000
FAST2SMS_API_KEY=your_fast2sms_api_key_here
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_google_places_api_key_here
```

### Step 3: Launch the Backend Server

## 🔒 Privacy & Offline Security Model

* **Sandboxed Storage**: Emergency contacts, local logs, and alert configurations are cached locally inside the client's web browser environment using the persistent **Zustand LocalStorage** middleware. Zero contact lists or location tracking histories are harvested or uploaded to remote databases.
* **Isolated Telemetry**: High-frequency accelerations are processed strictly on-device. No telemetry is transmitted to the server until a crash threshold is crossed and the countdown runs out.

## 📱 Real-Time Mobile Device Testing

1. Connect your hosting computer and smartphone to the **same Wi-Fi network**.
2. Identify the custom Vite HTTPS local network address in your console (e.g. `https://192.168.1.15:5173/`).
3. Load the URL on your mobile phone's browser.
4. **Grant permissions** to both the **device motion/accelerometer sensors** and **geolocation coordinates** when prompted.
5. Shake the device vigorously to simulate a collision force, listening for the siren and watching the triage countdown activate!
